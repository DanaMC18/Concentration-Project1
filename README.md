# A Match of Ice and Fire: Game of Concentration

"When you play the game of concentration, you ~~win~~ flip over cards or you ~~die~~ ...don't."

##User Guide

1. A user should be presented with a board of face-down cards.

2. When a user clicks one card, it should flip over and reveal its image.

4. A user should select a second card to flip over and reveal its image.

5. If the two flipped cards match each other they should remain face up. 

6. If the two flipped cards do not match they will flip back over onto their faces. 

7. Player then tries to match two more cards. And continue to do so until all cards have been matched with their pair.

8. A Timer will start from start of game and time a player until all cards have been matched. The lower the time the better.

9. A user should have the option to start a New Game at any point--cards will shuffle and flip back over while the Timer resets to 0.

10. If a user completes the game, they should be notified of their victory, their time, and encouraged to play again.

11. If a player has gotten the Best Time, they should be notified of this as well.

2. When a player starts the game and makes their first selection. In this case the selection is not a match, so the cards would flip back over. The Timer has started:

3. When a player is further into their game and some matches have been found. When two cards are matched correctly, their borders highlight yellow to indicate a correct match. These cards will remain faceup:

## Description

Concentration is a memory game. Players are presented with a board of face-down cards. Players choose one card to flip over, then pick a second one in an attempt to match it to the first.

When two cards are matched they remain face up. Eventually through memory (and chance), all of the cards will be face-up and the game is over.

Each new game, the cards are shuffled so the order is random. 

This particular game of concentration is A Song of Ice and Fire themed. Cards are house sigils, house words, and characters.

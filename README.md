## Description

Concentration is a memory game. Players are presented with a board of face-down cards. Players choose one card to flip over, then pick a second one in an attempt to match it to the first.

When two cards are matched they remain face up. Eventually through memory (and chance), all of the cards will be face-up and the game is over.

Each new game, the cards are shuffled so the order is random. 

This particular game of concentration is A Song of Ice and Fire themed. Cards are house sigils, house words, and characters.

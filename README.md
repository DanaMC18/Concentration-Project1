# Game of Thrones Concentration

When you play the game of thrones, you ~~win~~ flip over cards or you ~~die~~ don't. 

##User Guide

1. A user should be presented with a board of face-down cards.
2. When a user clicks two cards they should both flip over and remain flipped over so the user can see their faces.
3. If the two flipped cards match each other they should stay flipped.
4. If the two flipped cards do not match they will flip back over onto their faces. User should have enough time to actually see the faces of the cards before they return to a face-down position.
5. A counter will count the number of times a user has flipped over a pair of cards: the lower the score the better. 
6. A user should have the option to reset the board at any point. 
7. If a user complete's the game, they should be notified of their victory, their score, and encouraged to beat their score.
* If a player has gotten the best score, they should be notified of that as well.
